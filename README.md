# CustomButton

This project is an example of how to use @IBInspectable and @IBDesignable so we can play around with the variables of the 
views that we use in the Storyboard and that we then see in runtime.
In this example, we createad a variable to round the corners of the views, and another variable to toggle between
visible and invisible
